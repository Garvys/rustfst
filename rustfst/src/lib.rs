//! Rust implementation of Weighted Finite States Transducers.
//!
//! Rustfst is a library for constructing, combining, optimizing, and searching weighted
//! finite-state transducers (FSTs). Weighted finite-state transducers are automata where
//! each transition has an input label, an output label, and a weight.
//! The more familiar finite-state acceptor is represented as a transducer
//! with each transition's input and output label equal. Finite-state acceptors
//! are used to represent sets of strings (specifically, regular or rational sets);
//! finite-state transducers are used to represent binary relations between pairs of
//! strings (specifically, rational transductions). The weights can be used to represent
//! the cost of taking a particular transition.
//!
//! FSTs have key applications in speech recognition and synthesis, machine translation,
//! optical character recognition, pattern matching, string processing, machine learning,
//! information extraction and retrieval among others. Often a weighted transducer is used to
//! represent a probabilistic model (e.g., an n-gram model, pronunciation model). FSTs can be
//! optimized by determinization and minimization, models can be applied to hypothesis sets
//! (also represented as automata) or cascaded by finite-state composition, and the best
//! results can be selected by shortest-path algorithms.

//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! For a basic [example](#example) see the section below.
//!
//! Some simple and commonly encountered types of FSTs can be easily
//! created with the macro [`fst`] or the functions
//! [`acceptor`](utils::acceptor) and
//! [`transducer`](utils::transducer).
//!
//! For more complex cases you will likely start with the
//! [`VectorFst`](fst_impls::VectorFst) type, which will be imported
//! in the [`prelude`] along with most everything else you need.
//! [`VectorFst<TropicalWeight>`](fst_impls::VectorFst) corresponds
//! directly to the OpenFST `StdVectorFst`, and can be used to load
//! its files using [`read`](fst_traits::SerializableFst::read) or
//! [`read_text`](fst_traits::SerializableFst::read_text).
//!
//! Because "iteration" over an FST can mean many different things,
//! there are a variety of different iterators.  To iterate over state
//! IDs you may use
//! [`states_iter`](fst_traits::StateIterator::states_iter), while to
//! iterate over transitions out of a state, you may use
//! [`get_trs`](fst_traits::CoreFst::get_trs).  Since it is common to
//! iterate over both, this can be done using
//! [`fst_iter`](fst_traits::FstIterator::fst_iter) or
//! [`fst_into_iter`](fst_traits::FstIntoIterator::fst_into_iter).  It
//! is also very common to iterate over paths accepted by an FST,
//! which can be done with
//! [`paths_iter`](fst_traits::Fst::paths_iter), and as a convenience
//! for generating text,
//! [`string_paths_iter`](fst_traits::Fst::string_paths_iter).
//! Alternately, in the case of a linear FST, you may retrieve the
//! only possible path with
//! [`decode_linear_fst`](utils::decode_linear_fst).
//!
//! Note that iterating over paths is not the same thing as finding
//! the *shortest* path or paths, which is done with
//! [`shortest_path`](algorithms::shortest_path) (for a single path)
//! or
//! [`shortest_path_with_config`](algorithms::shortest_path_with_config)
//! (for N-shortest paths.
//!
//! For the complete list of algorithms, see the [`algorithms`] module.
//!
//! You may now be wondering, especially if you have previously used
//! such linguist-friendly tools as
//! [pyfoma](https://github.com/mhulden/pyfoma), "what if I just want
//! to *transduce some text*???"  The unfriendly answer is that
//! rustfst is a somewhat lower-level library, designed for
//! implementing things like speech recognizers.  The somewhat more
//! helpful answer is that you would do this by constructing an
//! [`acceptor`](utils::acceptor) for your input, which you will
//! [`compose`](algorithms::compose) with a
//! [`transducer`](utils::transducer), then
//! [`project`](algorithms::project) the result [to its
//! output](algorithms::ProjectType::ProjectOutput), and finally
//! [iterate over the paths](fst_traits::Fst::string_paths_iter) in
//! the resulting FST.

//! The API closely resembles that of OpenFST, with some
//! simplifications and changes to make it more idiomatic in Rust, notably
//! the use of `Tr` instead of `Arc`.  See [Differences from

//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use anyhow::Result;
//! use rustfst::prelude::*;
//! use rustfst::algorithms::determinize::{DeterminizeType, determinize};
//! use rustfst::algorithms::rm_epsilon::rm_epsilon;
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<()> {
//!     // Creates a empty wFST
//!     let mut fst = VectorFst::<TropicalWeight>::new();
//!
//!     // Add some states
//!     let s0 = fst.add_state();
//!     let s1 = fst.add_state();
//!     let s2 = fst.add_state();
//!
//!     // Set s0 as the start state
//!     fst.set_start(s0)?;
//!
//!     // Add a transition from s0 to s1
//!     fst.add_tr(s0, Tr::new(3, 5, 10.0, s1))?;
//!
//!     // Add a transition from s0 to s2
//!     fst.add_tr(s0, Tr::new(5, 7, 18.0, s2))?;
//!
//!     // Set s1 and s2 as final states
//!     fst.set_final(s1, 31.0)?;
//!     fst.set_final(s2, 45.0)?;
//!
//!     // Iter over all the paths in the wFST
//!     for p in fst.paths_iter() {
//!          println!("{:?}", p);
//!     }
//!
//!     // A lot of operations are available to modify/optimize the FST.
//!     // Here are a few examples :
//!
//!     // - Remove useless states.
//!     connect(&mut fst)?;
//!
//!     // - Optimize the FST by merging states with the same behaviour.
//!     minimize(&mut fst)?;
//!
//!     // - Copy all the input labels in the output.
//!     project(&mut fst, ProjectType::ProjectInput);
//!
//!     // - Remove epsilon transitions.
//!     rm_epsilon(&mut fst)?;
//!
//!     // - Compute an equivalent FST but deterministic.
//!     fst = determinize(&fst)?;
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Differences from OpenFST
//!
//! Here is a non-exhaustive list of ways in which Rustfst's API
//! differs from OpenFST:
//!
//! - The default epsilon symbol is `<eps>` and not `<epsilon>`.
//! - Functions and methods follow Rust naming conventions,
//!   e.g. `add_state` rather than `AddState`, but are otherwise mostly
//!   equivalent, except that:
//! - Transitions are called `Tr` and not `Arc`, because `Arc` has a
//!   rather different and well-established meaning in Rust, and rustfst
//!   uses it (`std::sync::Arc`, that is) to reference-count symbol
//!   tables.  All associated functions also use `tr`.
//! - Final states are not indicated by a final weight of `zero`.  You
//!   can test for finality using [`fst_traits::CoreFst::is_final`], and
//!   [`fst_traits::CoreFst::final_weight`] returns an [`Option`].  This
//!   requires some care when converting OpenFST code.
//! - Transitions can be accessed directly as a slice rather than requiring
//!   an iterator.
//! - Semiring operations are expressed as plain old methods rather
//!   than strange C++ things.  So write `w1.plus(w2)` rather than
//!   `Plus(w1, w2)`, for instance.
//! - Weights have in-place operations for `+`
//!   ([`plus_assign`](Semiring::plus_assign) and `*`
//!   ([`times_assign`](Semiring::times_assign).
//! - Most of the type aliases (which would be trait aliases in Rust) such
//!   as `StdArc`, `StdFst`, and so forth, are missing, but type inference
//!   allows us to avoid explicit type arguments in most cases, such as
//!   when calling [`Tr::new`], for instance.
//! - State IDs are unsigned, with [`NO_STATE_ID`] used as a flag value.
//!   They are also 32 bits by default (presumably, 4 billion states
//!   is enough for most applications).  This means you must take care to
//!   cast them to [`usize`] when using them as indices, and vice-versa,
//!   preferably checking for overflows
//! - Symbol IDs are also unsigned and 32-bits, with [`NO_LABEL`] used
//!   as a flag value.
